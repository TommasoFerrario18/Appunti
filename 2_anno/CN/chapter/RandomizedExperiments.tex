\chapter{Randomized Experiments}
\textbf{Randomized experiments} are noticeably different from observational studies.
In randomized experiments, the experimenter has complete control over the treatment
assignment mechanism.

This complete control over how treatment is chosen is what distinguishes randomized experiments from observational studies. In this simple experimental setup, the treatment
isnâ€™t a function of covariates at all, it's assigned randomly. In observational studies, the treatment is almost always a function of some of the covariate(s).

This difference is key to whether or not confounding is present in our data.

In randomized experiments, \textit{association} = \textit{causation} because they guarantee that there is no confounding.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[Y(1)] -  \mathbb{E}[Y(0)] = \mathbb{E}[Y| X = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y | X = 0]
\end{equation}

Since the treatment and control groups would be the same, in all aspects, except for treatment $X$, any difference in the outcomes $Y$ of the treatment and control groups is due to the treatment $X$.
\begin{definition}[\textbf{Covariate balance}]
    We have \textbf{covariate balance} if the distribution of covaraiates $Z$ is the same across treatment groups.
    \begin{equation}
        P(Z|X = 1) = P(Z|X = 0)
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Randomization implies covariate balance, across all covariates $Z$, even unobserved ones. Intuitively, this is because the treatment is chosen at random, regardless of $Z$, so the treatment and control groups should look very similar.
This is confirmed by the fact that in randomaze experiment, we chose randomly how
assign treatment so we are removing dipendences between the confounding variables
and the treatment, so there aren't any backdoor path from $X$ to $Y$ and $S=\{\emptyset\}$
is a sufficient adjustment to block any association flowing from $X$ to $Y$ except for
causal one.

We will now prove that association is equal to causation in randomized experiments by proving that:
\begin{equation*}
    P(Y|do(x)) = P(Y|x)
\end{equation*}
For the proof, the main property we utilize is that covariate balance implies $Z$ and $X$ are independent.

First, let $S = \{\emptyset\}$ be a \textbf{sufficent adjustment set} that potentially contains unobserved variables. Such an \textbf{adjustment set} $S$ must exist because we allow it to contain any variables, observed or unobserved.

Then, from the backdoor adjustements we get:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{ll}
        P(y|do(x)) & = \sum_s P(y|x, S = s)P(S = s)                \\
                   & = \sum_s \frac{P(y|x, s)P(x|s)P(s)}{P(x | s)} \\
                   & = \sum_s \frac{P(y, x, s)}{P(x | s)}          \\
                   & = \sum_s P(y, s| x)                           \\
                   & = P(y | x)
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

These means that all associations are causation.

\textbf{Exchangeability} gives us another perspective on why randomization makes causation equal to association. If the groups are exchangeable, we could exchange these groups, and the average outcomes would remain the same.

The final perspective that we'll look at to see why association is causation in randomized experiments is that of \textbf{graphical causal models}.

In regular observational data, there is almost always confounding. However, if we randomize  it doesn't depend on anything other than the output of a coin toss. Since the node has no incoming edges and thus no backdoor paths exist.
