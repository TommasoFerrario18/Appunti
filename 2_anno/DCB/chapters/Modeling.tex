The RNA transport information from nucleus, in other words, the DNA, to the
cytoplasm of a cell, where it mediates the process of translation to create proteins.

Once the information has passed into the protein it cannot get out again. The 
transfer information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to 
protein may be possible, but the transfer information from protein to protein,
or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible.
